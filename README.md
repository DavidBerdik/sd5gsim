# Classes
## basestation: 
**This class is the instance of the network simulator that represents
the controller of the SDN network. and it has the following attributes:**
* bs_id: a unique identifier for each basestation in the network
* n_count: total number of nodes in each network
* channel_count: total number of channels available for each network
* coordinates: pair of x and y coordinates that specify the basestation location
in the network
* dimensions: total dimensions of the network that belongs to the current basestation
* bs_nodes: list of all nodes reside in the network
* global_pool: list of all channels available for the network
* ch_allocations: a data structure (Python dictionary) that stores tuples of
nodes and the corresponding allocated channels.
* channel_capacity: individual channel capacity
* num_of_reqs: total number of communication requests made by all PNs
throughout the simulation time.
* num_of_blocked_reqs: total number of blocked communication requests due
to channel unavailability throughout the simulation time.
* num_of_transmitted_pkts: total number of packets transmitted between all
PNs throughout the simulation time.
* total_bandwidth: total available bandwidth for the network
* overhead: the network overhead which is the ratio between the number of
control packets sent to the basestation and the total amount of packets sent
throughout the simulation.
* throughput: average rate that shows the amount of successful delivery of packets
between nodes in the network.
* blocking_rate: the ratio between the number of blocked requests and total
number of requests.
* channel_utilization: the ratio between the amount of packet transmitted successfully
for a specific time period and the peak amount that the network
resources can handle.

**The basestation class also has the following methods:**
* assing_ch_to_node: a method for assigning channels to a PNs
* establish_connection: a method for creating and saving connection parameters
* terminate_connection: a method for terminating and revoking the assigned
channels from a PN
* plot_network: a method for drwaing the network.
## node:
**This class is the instance of the network simulator that represents the PNs in the SDN network and it has the following attributes:**
* node_id: a unique identifier for each PN in the network.
* vn_count: number of VNs for each PN.
* ant_count: number of antennas installed on each PN.
* ch_count: number of local channels allocated for the PN.
* coordinates: pair of x and y coordinates that specify the PN location in the
network
* parent_bs: the basestaion that is controlling the cell.
* local_channels: list of all allocated channels.
* local_antennas: list of all installed antennas.
* local_v_nodes: list of all VNs in the PN.

**The node class also has various methods as follows:**
* add_to_local_channels: a method for inserting the new allocated channel to
the local pool.

with other nodes.
* deactivate_v_node: a method for deactivating the VN after finishing the
transmission.
* activate_ant: a method for activating a antenna to be used for the
connection.
* deactivate_ant: a method for deactivating the antenna after finishing
the transmission.
* request_ch: a method for requesting a channel from the basestation to establish
a connection with other node in the network.
* print_info: a method for diplaying the node information.
## v_node class: 
**This class is the instance of the network simulator that represents the virtual instance of the PN used for creating a connection with other nodes in the SDN network and it has the following attributes:**
* v_node_id: a unique identifier for each VN in the network
* active: boolean variable that indicates of the VN is active or not.
* alloc_res_list: a data structure (Python dictionary) that stores the channels
allocated for the VN
* parent_nd: the node that is controlling the VN.
* parent_bs: the basestaion that is controlling the cell that this VN belongs to.

**The v_node class has also various methods, as follows:**
* add_res: a method to add a new antenna and channel pair to the
allocation list
* activate: a method for activating the VN
* deactivate: a method for deactivating the VN
* request_res: a method for requesting resources to start a connection
* vacate_res: a method for vacating the allocated resoures after the transmission
is finished.
## connection:
**This class stores information about the connections in the SDN network and it has the following attributes:**
* connection_id: a unique identifier for each connection in the network
* src_node: the sender node side of the connection
* src_vnode: the sender VN side of the connection
* src_ant: the sender antenna side of the connection
* src_ch: the sender channel side of the connection
* des_node: the receiver node side of the connection
* des_vnode: the receiver VN side of the connection
* des_ant: the receiver antenna side of the connection
## channel:
**This class is the instance of the network simulator that represents the channels used for the connection between nodes in the SDN network and it has the following attributes:**
* ch_id: a unique identifier for each channel available in the network
* power: the transmission power for the channel
* availability: a boolean indicator that used to indicate if the channel is available
to be used for connection between nodes
* allocations: list of all nodes allocated the channel
## antenna:
**This class is the instance of the network simulator that represents the antennas used for the connection between nodes in the SDN network and it has the following attributes:**
* ant_id: a unique identifier for each antenna available in the network
* active: a boolean indicator that used to indicate if the antenna is being
used in the connections
* power: the transmission power for the antenna.
